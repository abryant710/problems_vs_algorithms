# Problems vs. Algorithms

Seven algorithmic problems are presented in this module. Each problem is
accompanied by a description of the problem, a discussion of the algorithmic
techniques used to solve the problem, and a discussion of the time and space
complexities of the algorithm.

Refer to the .md files which provide the problem descriptions and solutions, including
the time and space complexities of the solutions.
