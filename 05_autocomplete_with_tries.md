# Analysis of the autocomplete with tries problem

## The problem

Given a list of words and a prefix, return all words that start with the prefix. The solution should run in O(p + n) time, where `p` is the length of the prefix and `n` is the number of words in the list.

## The solution

The solution is to use a trie. The idea is to store the words in a trie and then search for the prefix in the trie. The algorithm is:

1. Create a trie from the list of words.
2. Search for the prefix in the trie.
3. If the prefix is not found, return an empty list.
4. If the prefix is found, return all words in the trie that start with the prefix.

Algorithm complexity breakdown:

The time complexity of inserting a word into a trie is O(w), where `w` is the length of the word.
The time complexity of searching for a prefix in a trie is O(p), where `p` is the length of the prefix.
The time complexity of searching for all words in a trie that start with a prefix is O(n), where `n` is the number of words in the trie.
The time complexity of the overall algorithm is O(p + n).

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where `n` is the number of words in the list, due to the self.children dictionary attribute in the TrieNode class.
